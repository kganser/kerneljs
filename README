Kerneljs is a minimalist javascript interpreter with a nonblocking
API in the style of the browser and nodejs. Read more about it at
http://kganser.com/kerneljs.html

Kerneljs is still in early development. To build it, you must
first build the V8 library and have it in src/v8/libv8.a. It also
requires the v8 header src/v8/include/v8.h and libev at src/libev.
